# **DeepSeek vs. ChatGPT: AI Performance & User Behavior Dataset**  

## **Overview**  
This dataset is a **synthetically generated AI performance benchmark** that simulates real-world interactions across industries, regions, and devices. It provides insights into **user engagement, AI accuracy, response speed, and adoption trends** for both **ChatGPT (GPT-4-turbo) and DeepSeek (DeepSeek-Chat 1.5).**  


### **Key Features:**  
- **AI performance metrics** (accuracy, response time)  
- **User engagement trends** (churn, retention, active users)  
- **AI usage across industries** (education, debugging, content creation, etc.)  
- **Geographic distribution** of AI adoption  
- **Device preferences** (mobile, desktop, smart devices)  


> **Designed for AI Benchmarking, Business Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization (Power BI, SQL, Python).**

## **Disclaimer: This is Synthetic Data**  
This dataset was **artificially generated** using **Python (`faker` library) and SQL** to create a **realistic but fictional AI usage dataset**.  

- **No real user data was collected**‚Äîthis dataset is strictly for **educational, analytical, and visualization purposes**.  
- It represents **general AI trends** but is **not sourced from actual AI user logs**.

## **Can You Access Real DeepSeek or ChatGPT Data?**  

### **DeepSeek Data Access**  
To access **real DeepSeek data**, you need to use the **DeepSeek API**, which requires signing up for an API key. This allows you to connect your code to their models using the **OpenAI SDK**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Privacy Considerations:**  
- DeepSeek **stores all user data on servers in China**.  
- There are concerns about potential data access by **Chinese government authorities**.  
- **Before using the DeepSeek API, ensure you understand the privacy risks.**  

üîó **More info:** [DeepSeek API Documentation](https://deepseek.com/)

### **ChatGPT Data Access**  
No, you **cannot directly access** global user data for ChatGPT.  

- **Why?** OpenAI prioritizes user privacy and does not share **comprehensive individual user data**.  
- However, **aggregated insights** can be analyzed using:  
  - **Website traffic statistics**  
  - **Regional usage patterns**  
  - **Search trends** (SimilarWeb, Google Trends, etc.)  

While these methods provide **some level of insight**, **detailed ChatGPT user behavior data remains private**.
